# Image Segmentation Models

This repository contains multiple deep learning models for **semantic segmentation**, trained and evaluated on **Mapillary Vistas** and two additional datasets.  
The goal of this project is to benchmark different segmentation architectures on diverse datasets and analyze their performance.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

The models are trained and evaluated on the following datasets:

1. **[Mapillary Vistas Dataset](https://www.mapillary.com/dataset/vistas)**  
2. **[CityScapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/)**
3. **[CARLA- CAR Learning to Act Dataset](https://carla.org/)**
